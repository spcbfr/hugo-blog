Hello once again to my redesigned blog, this time using [[https://gohugo.io][hugo]] as the backend with [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]] which converts my org-written blog posts to markdown.

through out this post, I will be testing ox-hugo's features and see what is possible !
** Heading 1
this is fun, hugo supports rich text, so I can have, *bold* and /italic/ text and even ~inline code blocks~
*** heading 2
I don't think I'll ever go beyond heading 2, this is a *very* useful bit of javascript code
#+begin_src js
console.log("hello world")
for(let i = 0; i > 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
}
#+end_src

#+begin_quote
I don't like how quote blocks look, but that is fine tbh.
#+end_quote
I can have lists:
+ Milk
+ House
+ Door
and even ordered ones:
1. what's up
2. I like this very much
